   - You're high-functioning but emotionally exhausted. Something is 'off' but you can't name it.

3. **AI Anxiety**
   - You fear becoming irrelevant in a world that's moving too fast. Will you be replaced?

4. **Lost Confidence**
   - You never feel truly confident. Imposter syndrome follows you into every room.

5. **Emotional Dysregulation**
   - Your emotions spike and crash. You're triggered easily and can't get back to center.

6. **Living Small**
   - You're terrified of living a small life—of not being able to protect or provide for your family.

**Quote:**
