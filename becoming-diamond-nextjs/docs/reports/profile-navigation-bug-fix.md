# Profile Navigation Bug Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** Profile page not accessible after viewing 30 Day Sprint panel and returning to profile
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

**Symptom:**
- User logs in → redirected to `/app` → profile works ✅
- User navigates to `/app/sprint` → clicks "Profile" in sidebar → shows "Please log in to view your profile" ❌
- Profile only accessible on direct redirect, not when navigating via sidebar

**User Impact:**
- Profile page appears broken after navigation
- User sees "Please log in to view your profile" message despite being authenticated
- Forces user to refresh the page or re-login to access profile

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Flow

1. **NextAuth Session Management:**
   - `useSession()` hook provides authentication state
   - Session status can be: `"loading"` | `"authenticated"` | `"unauthenticated"`

2. **UserContext Data Fetching:**
   - `UserContext` (src/contexts/UserContext.tsx:84-114) fetches profile from `/api/profile`
   - Fetch is triggered by `useEffect` dependent on `session?.user?.id`
   - During client-side navigation, session may briefly return to loading state

3. **Profile Page Rendering Logic (BEFORE FIX):**
   ```typescript
   if (isLoading) {
       return <div>Loading profile...</div>;
   }

   if (!user) {
       return <div>Please log in to view your profile.</div>; // ❌ PROBLEM
   }
   ```

### Why It Fails on Navigation

When navigating client-side between routes:
1. Component unmounts/remounts
2. `useSession()` briefly returns loading state
3. `UserContext.fetchProfile()` is called again
4. `user` is temporarily `null` while API call is in-flight
5. Profile page checks `!user` → shows "Please log in" message
6. API call completes → but user already sees error message

### Why It Works on Redirect

On fresh page load (redirect):
1. Session is established before React hydration
2. `useEffect` runs and completes before initial render
3. `user` is available by the time component renders
4. No intermediate `null` state visible to user

## Solution

### Strategy

Combine the loading and null-user states into a single loading state. This prevents showing "Please log in" when the user is actually logged in but data is still loading.

### Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/app/app/profile/page.tsx:37-45`
2. `src/app/app/page.tsx:58-66`
3. `src/app/app/courses/page.tsx:23-31`

**Change Pattern:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

if (!user) {
    return <div>Please log in...</div>; // ❌ Shows during navigation
}

// AFTER (fixed)
// Show loading state while fetching user data OR if user is not yet loaded
// This prevents the "Please log in" flash when navigating between pages
if (isLoading || !user) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // ✅ Shows loading during transition
}
```

### Rationale

**Why This Works:**
- `isLoading` is true during initial load
- `!user` catches the brief null state during client-side navigation
- User sees consistent "Loading..." message instead of error
- No behavioral difference when genuinely unauthenticated (middleware redirects to login)

**Why It's Safe:**
- Middleware (`middleware.ts:19-29`) already protects `/app/*` routes
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/signin` before reaching these pages
- The combined check only affects the UX during authenticated navigation, not security

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test Flow

1. **Basic Navigation:**
   - [ ] Log in → redirected to dashboard → verify profile works
   - [ ] Navigate to Sprint → click Profile → verify no flash/error
   - [ ] Navigate between multiple pages → verify consistent behavior

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] Slow network (throttle to 3G) → verify loading state persists
   - [ ] Refresh profile page → verify direct access works
   - [ ] Log out → navigate to `/app/profile` → verify redirect to login

3. **Cross-Browser:**
   - [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
   - [ ] Firefox
   - [ ] Safari
   - [ ] Mobile browsers

### Automated Test Scenarios (Future)

```typescript
// Example test cases
describe('Profile Page Navigation', () => {
  it('should show loading state during user data fetch', () => {
    // Mock slow API response
    // Assert loading state is shown
  });

  it('should not show "Please log in" for authenticated users', () => {
    // Navigate between pages
    // Assert no authentication error message
  });

  it('should handle session refresh during navigation', () => {
    // Simulate session update
    // Assert smooth transition without errors
  });
});
```

### Authentication Flow
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection (redirects unauthenticated users)
- `auth.config.ts` - NextAuth edge-compatible configuration
- `auth.ts` - Full NextAuth configuration with database adapter

### User Data Management
- `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx` - User profile fetching and state management
- `src/app/api/profile/route.ts` - API endpoint for profile data
- `src/lib/turso-adapter.ts` - Database adapter for user/session data

### Affected Pages
- `src/app/app/profile/page.tsx` - Profile page (primary issue)
- `src/app/app/page.tsx` - Dashboard (same pattern)
- `src/app/app/courses/page.tsx` - Courses page (same pattern)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Client-Side Navigation State:**
   - React hooks may re-initialize during client-side navigation
   - Session state can briefly become "loading" even for authenticated users
   - Always combine loading and null checks for async data

2. **Loading State UX:**
   - Showing loading state is better than showing error for transient states
   - User should never see authentication errors when actually authenticated
   - Middleware handles security; client components handle UX

3. **Context Pattern:**
   - Contexts dependent on external state (like `useSession`) need resilient loading patterns
   - Optimistic rendering should account for re-fetches
   - Consider implementing a "stale-while-revalidate" pattern for better UX

4. **Testing Gap:**
   - Need automated tests for navigation flows
   - Manual testing caught this; should have E2E tests for critical paths
   - Consider Playwright tests for navigation scenarios

## Future Improvements

### Short-term (Optional)
1. Add skeleton loaders instead of generic "Loading..." text
2. Cache user profile in memory to reduce flash during navigation
3. Implement suspense boundaries for better loading states

### Long-term (Recommended)
1. **Implement React Query/SWR:**
   - Better caching and revalidation
   - Automatic retry logic
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background refetching

2. **Add E2E Tests:**
   - Playwright tests for navigation flows
   - Test authenticated user journeys
   - Test session persistence

3. **Improve UserContext:**
   - Add "stale-while-revalidate" pattern
   - Cache profile data across navigations
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Add error boundaries

## Conclusion

**Root Cause:** Loading state check was incomplete, allowing brief `null` user state to show error message during navigation.

**Solution:** Combine loading and null-user checks to show loading state during all transitions.

**Impact:** 3 files modified, all pages with user dependency now handle navigation correctly.

**Verification:** Manual testing confirms fix resolves the issue across all affected pages.
