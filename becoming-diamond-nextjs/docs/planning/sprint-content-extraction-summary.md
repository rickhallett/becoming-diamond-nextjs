# Sprint Video Narrative Extraction - Quick Summary

**Full Plan**: See `docs/specs/sprint-video-narrative-extraction.prd.md`

---

## The Plan in 60 Seconds

**Goal**: Extract narratives from 28 sprint videos and use them as the body content for each day's markdown file.

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid (AI + Manual)
1. Use Whisper AI to transcribe videos (4 hours)
2. Format with GPT-4/Claude + manual editing (8 hours)
3. Integrate into markdown files (2 hours)
4. Review and QA (2 hours)

**Total Time**: 1.5-2 days
**Total Cost**: ~$14 (Whisper is free, GPT-4 formatting)

---

## Why This Approach?

‚úÖ **Fast**: Whisper transcribes in ~5 min per video
‚úÖ **Accurate**: 95%+ accuracy with medium model
‚úÖ **Quality**: Manual editing preserves authentic voice
‚úÖ **Scalable**: Can process all 28 videos in 2 days
‚úÖ **Professional**: Output worthy of paid course

---

## Three Approach Options

| Approach | Time | Cost | Quality | Recommended |
|----------|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **AI Only** (Whisper + GPT-4) | 1 day | $14 | 85% | Good for MVP |
| **Hybrid** (AI + Manual) | 1.5 days | $14 | 95% | ‚úÖ **Best** |
| **Manual** (Type everything) | 3 days | $0 | 100% | Slow |

---

## Quick Start Steps

### Step 1: Download Videos (2 hours)
```bash
# Create script to download from Bunny
node scripts/download-bunny-videos.js

# Or download manually from Bunny dashboard
# Save to: ./videos/day-01.mp4, day-02.mp4, etc.
```

### Step 2: Transcribe with Whisper (2 hours)
```bash
# Install Whisper
pip install openai-whisper

# Transcribe all videos
for video in videos/*.mp4; do
  whisper "$video" --model medium --language en
done

# Outputs: ./day-01.txt, ./day-02.txt, etc.
```

### Step 3: Format with AI (4 hours)
```bash
# For each transcript:
# 1. Copy raw transcript
# 2. Paste into Claude/GPT-4 with this prompt:

"Format this video transcript as engaging markdown for a personal development course.
Remove filler words, add headings, use bullet lists, bold key terms, and keep the
authentic voice. Include exercises and key takeaways."

# 3. Save formatted version
# 4. Quick review while watching video
```

### Step 4: Integrate into Markdown (2 hours)
```javascript
// Run automation script
node scripts/integrate-transcripts.js

// This updates content/sprint/day-XX.md with:
// - Original frontmatter
// - Video embed at top
// - Formatted narrative below
```

### Step 5: Review (2 hours)
```bash
# Test in browser
npm run dev

# Visit each day and verify:
# ‚úÖ Video plays
# ‚úÖ Content displays correctly
# ‚úÖ Narrative matches video
# ‚úÖ Formatting looks good
```

## Example Output

**Before** (current):
```markdown
# Day 1: Welcome to Your Transformation

{{video:abc123}}

Welcome to the beginning of your 30-day journey...

[Generic placeholder text]
```

**After** (with narrative):
```markdown
# Day 1: Welcome to Your Transformation

{{video:abc123}}

Welcome to day one of your transformation into diamond. Today marks the first step
in a process that will challenge you, inspire you, and help you unlock your true potential.

## The Diamond Under Pressure

A diamond doesn't start as a diamond. It begins as coal‚Äîordinary, unrefined, full of
potential but unrealized. Through **intense pressure** and time, it transforms into
something extraordinary.

You are that coal. This 30-day sprint is the pressure that will transform you.

### The Three Pillars

1. **Consistency Over Intensity** - Small daily actions compound
2. **Pressure Creates Diamonds** - Embrace discomfort as growth
3. **Clarity Before Action** - Know your why first

## Your Challenge Today

Take 10 minutes to reflect on these questions:
- What brought you to this sprint?
- What do you hope to achieve by Day 30?
- What old version of yourself are you ready to leave behind?

## Key Takeaway

> "Transformation isn't about massive overnight change. It's about showing up every
> single day, even when it's hard. That's when the pressure creates the diamond."
```
