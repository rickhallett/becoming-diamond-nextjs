# Resend Email Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete
**Time Spent:** ~2 hours

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✅

```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

**Packages Added:**
- `@react-email/components` v0.5.6 - React components for email templates
- `@react-email/render` v1.3.2 - Server-side email rendering

**Note:** `resend` v6.1.2 was already installed in the project.

---

### 2. Database Schema Updates ✅

**Migration File:** `migrations/003_add_email_tracking_to_leads.sql`

**New Columns Added to `leads` Table:**
- `email_sent_at` (TEXT) - Timestamp when email was sent
- `email_status` (TEXT) - Status: `pending`, `sent`, `failed`, `bounced`
- `email_id` (TEXT) - Resend email ID for tracking
- `unsubscribe_token` (TEXT, UNIQUE) - Unique token for unsubscribe links

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_leads_unsubscribe_token` - Fast token lookups for unsubscribe
- `idx_leads_email_status` - Filtering by email status

**To Apply Migration:**
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

---

### 3. Email Template Created ✅

**File:** `src/emails/welcome-email.tsx`

**Template Features:**
- Professional HTML email with brand colors (black, diamond blue)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Welcome message with Diamond Sprint materials CTA
- Benefit list (presence, nervous system, identity rewiring)
- Testimonial section
- Secondary CTA for book purchase
- Legal footer with unsubscribe link
- Plain text fallback support

**Design System:**
- Background: `#000000` (black)
- Primary: `#4fc3f7` (diamond blue)
- Text: `#ffffff` (white)
- Secondary text: `#9ca3af` (gray-400)
- Max width: 600px (standard email width)

---

### 4. Resend Client Utility ✅

**File:** `src/lib/resend.ts`

**Functions Implemented:**

#### `sendWelcomeEmail(params)`
- Sends welcome email to new leads
- Includes retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Returns `{ success: boolean, emailId?: string, error?: string }`
- Non-blocking - doesn't fail API call if email fails

#### `sendAdminNotification(params)`
- Optional admin notification for new leads
- Only sends if `RESEND_ADMIN_EMAIL` is configured
- Includes lead details and UTM parameters
- Non-blocking - errors logged but don't fail request

#### `validateEmailConfig()`
- Validates required environment variables
- Returns `{ valid: boolean, errors: string[] }`
- Can be called on app startup

---

### 5. API Route Updates ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { sendWelcomeEmail, sendAdminNotification } from '@/lib/resend';
   ```

2. **Generate Unsubscribe Token:**
   ```typescript
   const unsubscribeToken = nanoid(32);
   ```

3. **Updated INSERT Statement:**
   - Added `unsubscribe_token` column
   - Increased parameter count from 16 to 17

4. **Email Sending Logic:**
   - Call `sendWelcomeEmail()` after lead insertion
   - Update database with email status (`sent` or `failed`)
   - Log email delivery result
   - Send admin notification (optional)
   - Graceful degradation - form submission succeeds even if email fails

**Email Flow:**
```
Lead Submission
    ↓
Insert to Database (with unsubscribe_token)
    ↓
Send Welcome Email (3 retry attempts)
    ↓
Update Database (email_status, email_sent_at, email_id)
    ↓
Send Admin Notification (optional)
    ↓
Return Success Response
```

### 6. Unsubscribe Endpoint ✅

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/unsubscribe?token=xxx`

**Features:**
- Token validation
- Updates `subscribed` to `0` in database
- Beautiful HTML response page
- Success/error states with appropriate styling
- Links back to home, privacy, terms
- Mobile-responsive design

**Response Types:**

- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Submit lead form with your email
- [ ] Check inbox for welcome email
- [ ] Click unsubscribe link and verify page loads
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT * FROM leads ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Verify `email_status = 'sent'` and `email_sent_at` is populated

### Production Testing

- [ ] Verify domain in Resend (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Add environment variables to Vercel
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Test lead submission on production site

2. **Verify Domain**
   - Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Wait for verification (5-10 minutes)

3. **Generate API Key**
   - Create API key in Resend dashboard
   - Add to Vercel environment variables

4. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

5. **Deploy to Production**
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy with new env vars

6. **Test Email Delivery**
   - Submit test lead
   - Check inbox and Resend dashboard

### Phase 2 (Future Enhancements):

1. **Welcome Email Sequence (Drip Campaign)**
   - Day 1: Welcome + materials

   - Day 5: Success stories + book CTA
   - Day 7: Last chance reminder

2. **Email Analytics**
   - Resend webhooks for open/click tracking
   - Dashboard showing email performance
   - A/B testing for subject lines

3. **Segmentation**

## Performance Metrics

**Target Metrics:**
- Delivery Rate: >95%
- Open Rate: >20% (industry average: 50-60% for welcome emails)
- Click-Through Rate: >10%
- Bounce Rate: <2%
- Unsubscribe Rate: <0.5%

**Monitoring:**
- Resend Dashboard: Real-time delivery stats
- Application Logs: Email sending errors
- Database Queries: Email status distribution

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Email Preview in Dev Mode**
   - Use `npx react-email dev` to preview templates locally
   - Or check Resend dashboard after sending

2. **Retry Logic in API Route**
   - Current retry is synchronous (blocks API response)
   - Future: Move to background job queue for better UX

3. **No Email Queue System**
   - Emails sent immediately on form submission
   - Future: Use Redis queue for better reliability

4. **No Bulk Email Management**
   - Can't send emails to multiple leads at once
   - Future: Add bulk email API endpoint

5. **Admin Notifications are Optional**
   - Only work if `RESEND_ADMIN_EMAIL` is set
   - Future: Add admin dashboard for lead management
