# Breaking Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are the invisible chains that keep you from reaching your potential. Today, we identify and begin to break them.

## Common Limiting Beliefs

- "I'm not smart/talented/worthy enough"
- "Success is for other people"
- "I'm too old/young to start"
- "I don't have what it takes"
- "I'll fail anyway, so why try?"

## The Belief Audit

### Step 1: Identify
Write down 3 beliefs that have held you back from pursuing what you want.

### Step 2: Question
For each belief, ask:
- Is this absolutely true?
- What evidence contradicts this belief?
- What would I do if I didn't have this belief?

### Step 3: Reframe
Transform each limiting belief into an empowering one.

**Example:**
- **Limiting**: "I'm not creative enough"
- **Empowering**: "Creativity is a skill I can develop with practice"

## Today's Action

Choose one limiting belief and find three pieces of evidence that contradict it. Write them down.

## Remember

Your beliefs shape your reality. Change your beliefs, change your life.
