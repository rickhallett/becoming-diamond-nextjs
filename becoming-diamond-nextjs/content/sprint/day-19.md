# Learning Acceleration

The ability to learn quickly is the ultimate meta-skill. Today, you learn how to learn.

## The Learning Crisis

Traditional education taught you to:
- Memorize facts (forgotten in weeks)
- Learn passively (lectures, reading)
- Study in isolation (no application)

**Result**: Slow acquisition, poor retention, minimal transfer.

## The 5 Principles of Accelerated Learning

### 1. Active Recall Over Passive Review

**Don't**: Re-read notes, highlight text
**Do**: Close the book, test yourself

**The Science**: Retrieval strengthens memory 10x more than re-exposure.

**Application**: After learning anything, immediately write down what you remember without looking.

### 2. Spaced Repetition Over Cramming

**The Pattern**:
- Review after 1 day
- Review after 3 days
- Review after 7 days
- Review after 14 days
- Review after 30 days

**Tool**: Anki app for automated spaced repetition

### 3. Interleaving Over Blocked Practice

**Don't**: Practice skill A for 1 hour, then skill B for 1 hour
**Do**: Alternate A-B-A-B in 15-minute blocks

**Why**: Interleaving builds pattern recognition and transfer ability.

### 4. Immediate Application Over Delayed Use

**The 24-Hour Rule**: Use new knowledge within 24 hours or lose 70% of it.

**Action Steps**:
- Teach someone else
- Apply to a real problem
- Create something with it
- Explain it in your own words

### 5. Feedback Loops Over Practice Alone

**Poor feedback**: Delayed, general ("good job")
**Rich feedback**: Immediate, specific ("Your X was strong, improve Y by doing Z")

**How to get it**:
- Record yourself and self-review
- Hire a coach or mentor
- Join communities with peer review
- Use AI for immediate feedback

## The Ultra-Learning Framework

**Phase 1: Deconstruction (10%)**
- What are the core sub-skills?
- What's the minimum viable competence?
- Who are the top performers? What do they do differently?

**Phase 2: Targeted Practice (80%)**
- Isolate weakest sub-skill
- Practice at edge of ability (70% success rate)
- Get immediate feedback
- Adjust and repeat

**Phase 3: Integration (10%)**
- Combine sub-skills in realistic scenarios
- Teach others
- Create original work

## The 20-Hour Rule

You can go from knowing nothing to being "pretty good" at most skills in 20 hours of deliberate practice.

**The catch**: It must be:
- **Focused**: No distractions
- **Deliberate**: Practicing weak points, not strengths
- **Feedback-rich**: Immediate knowledge of results

## Your Learning Project

Choose one skill to accelerate this month:

**Skill**: _____
**Why**: _____
**Core sub-skills** (list 3-5): _____
**Practice schedule**: _____ min/day
**Feedback source**: _____

## Today's Action

Start your 20-hour learning project. Block 30 minutes tomorrow for first session.

## Remember

You're not "bad at learning." You were just taught bad learning methods.
