# Communication Mastery - Listening

Most people don't listen to understand. They listen to respond. Today, you learn to truly hear others.

## The Listening Crisis

- Average person listens at 25% efficiency
- We think 4x faster than people speak
- Most "conversations" are parallel monologues
- Poor listening damages relationships and opportunities

## Types of Listening

### Level 1: Internal Listening
Focused on yourself—what you'll say next, how this affects you

### Level 2: Focused Listening
Attention on the speaker—their words, tone, body language

### Level 3: Global Listening
Awareness of what's NOT being said—energy, environment, context

**Goal**: Operate at Level 2-3, not Level 1

## The Active Listening Framework

### 1. Presence
- Put away phone
- Make eye contact
- Open body language
- Silent your internal dialogue

### 2. Clarification
Ask questions to understand:
- "Tell me more about..."
- "What did you mean by...?"
- "Help me understand..."

### 3. Reflection
Mirror back what you heard:
- "So what I'm hearing is..."
- "It sounds like you're feeling..."
- "Let me make sure I understand..."

### 4. Validation
Acknowledge their experience:
- "That makes sense"
- "I can see why you'd feel that way"
- "That sounds challenging"

### 5. Pause
Resist the urge to immediately respond. Count to 3 before speaking.

## What Destroys Listening

- **Interrupting**: Shows you value your words over theirs
- **One-upping**: "That's nothing, I..."
- **Fixing**: Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem
- **Judging**: Evaluating instead of understanding
- **Rehearsing**: Mentally preparing your response while they speak

## The Listening Challenge

This week, practice Level 2-3 listening in every conversation:
- With your partner: Truly hear what they're saying
- With colleagues: Understand before responding
- With strangers: Notice what you usually miss

## Listening Meditation

For 2 minutes right now:
1. Close your eyes
2. Listen to every sound around you
3. Don't label or judge—just hear
4. Notice sounds you normally filter out

This is the quality of attention to bring to conversations.

## Today's Practice

In your next conversation, practice the 3-second pause. After they finish speaking, count "1-2-3" before responding.

## Remember

People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Listening is caring in action.
