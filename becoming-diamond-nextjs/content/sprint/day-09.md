# Deep Work in a Distracted World

{{video:0e8b5da3-4312-466e-b500-5fe34dab888f}}

In a world optimized for distraction, the ability to focus deeply is a superpower. Today, you'll learn to cultivate it.

## What is Deep Work?

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. It's the skill that produces exceptional results.

**Shallow Work**: Email, meetings, social media, administrative tasks
**Deep Work**: Strategic planning, creative projects, skill development, complex problem-solving

## The Cost of Distraction

Every time you switch tasks, your brain needs 15-20 minutes to fully re-engage. Four interruptions = 1 hour of lost productivity.

## The Deep Work Protocol

### 1. Time Blocking (Schedule It)
- Block 90-120 minute deep work sessions
- Protect these blocks like important meetings
- Schedule 2-3 blocks per week to start

### 2. Environment Design (Eliminate Triggers)
- Phone in another room or airplane mode
- Close all browser tabs except what you need
- Use website blockers if needed
- Clear workspace, clear mind

### 3. Ritual Creation (Signal Your Brain)
- Same time, same place when possible
- Start with a specific cue (coffee, music, timer)
- End with a shutdown ritual

### 4. Progressive Training (Build Capacity)
- Start with 45 minutes if 90 feels impossible
- Gradually extend duration
- Quality over quantity initially

## Common Deep Work Mistakes

❌ Checking "just one email" during your block
❌ Taking calls or responding to messages
❌ Scheduling deep work when you're already tired
❌ Not planning what you'll work on beforehand

*"The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable."* - Cal Newport
