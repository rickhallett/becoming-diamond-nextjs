# Sleep Optimization

Everything you've built in this sprint depends on sleep. Poor sleep destroys productivity, decision-making, emotional control, and health. Today, you optimize the most important 8 hours of your day.

## The Sleep Crisis

**70% of adults** don't get enough sleep. The cost:
- Reduced cognitive function (equivalent to being drunk)
- Poor emotional regulation
- Weight gain and metabolic issues
- Weakened immune system
- Increased risk of disease
- Shortened lifespan

**You can't out-hustle bad sleep.**

## How Much Sleep Do You Actually Need?

Most adults: 7-9 hours
Athletic/high performers: 8-10 hours

**Test**: For one week, go to bed at the same time and wake WITHOUT an alarm. Average the sleep duration. That's your need.

## The Sleep Optimization Protocol

### 1. Consistency (Most Important)

**Same bedtime and wake time every day** (including weekends)

Your circadian rhythm thrives on consistency. Variable sleep schedule = jet lag every week.

**Set your wake time first**, then work backwards:
- Need 8 hours sleep
- Want to wake at 6am
- In bed by 9:30pm (accounting for sleep latency)

### 2. Sleep Environment Design

**Temperature**: 65-68°F (18-20°C) is optimal
**Darkness**: Blackout curtains or sleep mask
**Silence**: Earplugs or white noise machine
**Comfort**: Quality mattress and pillow (you spend 1/3 of life here)
**Electronics**: No screens in bedroom

### 3. Pre-Sleep Routine (Wind-Down)

**2-3 hours before bed**:
- Dim lights (signals melatonin production)
- Reduce stimulation (no intense work, arguments, news)
- No caffeine after 2pm
- No alcohol (destroys REM sleep quality)

**1 hour before bed**:
- No screens (blue light suppresses melatonin)
- Light reading, journaling, or meditation
- Prepare for tomorrow (reduces anxiety)
- Gratitude practice

**Bedtime ritual** (signals to brain it's sleep time):
- Brush teeth
- Change into sleep clothes
- Read fiction 10-15 minutes
- Lights out

### 4. Morning Routine (Supports Night Sleep)

**Upon waking**:
- Sunlight exposure (10-15 min within first hour)
- Movement (brief walk or stretching)
- Hydration (16 oz water)
- No phone for first 30 minutes

**Why**: Morning light regulates circadian rhythm for better sleep tonight.

### 5. Napping Strategy

**Good nap**: 10-20 minutes (increases alertness)
**Dangerous nap**: 30-60 minutes (sleep inertia)
**Full cycle nap**: 90 minutes (complete sleep cycle)

**Best time**: 1-3pm (natural circadian dip)
**Latest**: 3pm (later impacts nighttime sleep)

## The Sleep Saboteurs

**Eliminate these**:
- Caffeine after 2pm (6-hour half-life)
- Alcohol (sedates but destroys quality)
- Large meals within 3 hours of bed
- Intense exercise within 3 hours of bed
- Stress without outlet
- Inconsistent schedule

## The Non-Negotiable Sleep Rules

1. **Protect your sleep like a meeting with your future self**
2. **No email/work after 8pm**
3. **Phone charges outside bedroom**
4. **Same schedule weekends and weekdays**
5. **Dark, cold, quiet environment**

## Sleep Tracking (Optional)

Use:
- Oura Ring
- WHOOP
- Apple Watch sleep tracking
- Sleep Cycle app

**Track**:
- Total sleep time
- Sleep quality/efficiency
- REM and deep sleep
- Heart rate variability (stress indicator)

## Your Sleep Commitment

**Current average sleep**: _____ hours
**Target sleep**: _____ hours
**Bedtime**: _____
**Wake time**: _____

**Non-negotiable changes I'm making**:
1. _____
2. _____
3. _____

## Today's Action

Set a bedtime alarm for 30 minutes before target bedtime. Start wind-down routine.

## Remember

Sleep isn't time wasted. It's the force multiplier for everything else. Prioritize it ruthlessly.
