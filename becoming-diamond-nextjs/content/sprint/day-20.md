# Digital Minimalism

{{video:649a2a38-db81-4912-94da-c70c6bc1e709}}

Your attention is being sold to the highest bidder. Today, you take it back.

## The Attention Economy

You're not the customer of social media—you're the product. Your attention is what's being sold to advertisers.

**The numbers**:
- Average person: 3+ hours/day on phone
- 96 phone checks per day
- Social media: Designed to be addictive
- Cost: Your time, focus, mental health, and real relationships

## The Digital Audit

### Screen Time Analysis
Check your phone's screen time report. Write down:
- **Total daily average**: _____ hours
- **Top 3 apps**: _____
- **Pickups per day**: _____
- **First phone check after waking**: _____ minutes

### Brutal Honesty Questions
- Could I achieve my goals with 50% less screen time?
- Am I using technology, or is it using me?
- If I used this time for deep work, what could I accomplish?

## The Digital Minimalism Protocol

### Phase 1: Digital Declutter (This Week)

**Delete**:
- Apps you haven't used in 30 days
- Apps that serve no clear purpose
- Duplicate apps (3 note apps → 1)
- Games designed to waste time

**Keep** only if it:
- Serves a specific, valuable purpose
- Can't be replaced by website (phone browser)
- Significantly improves your life

### Phase 2: Reclaim Defaults (Next Week)

**Change**:
- **Morning**: Don't check phone for first hour
- **Work**: Phone in another room during deep work
- **Evening**: No screens 1 hour before bed
- **Social**: Delete social media apps, keep logged in on computer only

**Create friction**:
- Remove apps from home screen
- Turn off ALL notifications except calls/texts
- Use grayscale mode
- Set app time limits (iOS/Android built-in)

### Phase 3: Replace with Analog (Ongoing)

For every digital habit you remove, add an analog alternative:
- Social media scrolling → Reading physical books
- YouTube rabbit holes → Taking walks
- News feeds → Journaling
- Mindless gaming → Real conversations

## The 30-Day Digital Detox Challenge

**Rules**:
1. Delete social media apps (keep on computer, check 1x/day max)
2. No phone before 8am or after 8pm
3. No phone in bedroom (buy alarm clock)
4. Phone on airplane mode during deep work
5. One full day per week completely screen-free (except essential)

## What You'll Gain

- 1-3 hours per day
- Ability to think without distraction
- Reduced anxiety and comparison
- Real presence with people you love
- Space for what actually matters

## Common Resistance

**"But I need it for work"**: Do you need the APPS or just the phone? Most work can happen on computer.

**"But I'll miss important things"**: If it's truly important, they'll call. Everything else can wait.

**"But I'll be bored"**: Good. Boredom is where creativity lives.

## Today's Action

1. Delete 3 apps that don't serve your goals
2. Turn off all non-essential notifications
3. Move remaining apps off home screen (into folders)
4. Set your first screen-free morning (tomorrow?)

## 30-Day Commitment

I commit to: _____
Starting: _____
Accountability partner: _____

## Remember

Your phone should be a tool you use intentionally, not a slot machine you check compulsively.
