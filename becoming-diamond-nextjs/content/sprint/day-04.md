# Identifying Your Core Values

Your core values are the compass that guides every decision you make. Today, we'll uncover what truly matters to you.

## What Are Core Values?

Core values are the fundamental beliefs that dictate your behavior and actions. They're the standards by which you evaluate your life choices.

## Exercise: The Values Assessment

1. **Review the list**: Look at common values (integrity, freedom, family, growth, creativity, security, adventure)
2. **Narrow down**: Choose your top 10
3. **Prioritize**: Rank your top 5
4. **Define**: Write what each value means to you specifically

## Why This Matters

When your actions align with your values, you experience:
- Greater authenticity
- Reduced internal conflict
- Clear decision-making
- Increased life satisfaction
