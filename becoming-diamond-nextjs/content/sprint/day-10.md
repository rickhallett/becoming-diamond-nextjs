# The Five People Principle

You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Today, we audit and optimize your inner circle.

## Why Relationships Matter

Your relationships shape:
- Your mindset and beliefs
- Your habits and behaviors
- Your opportunities and network
- Your emotional state and energy

## The Five People Audit

### Step 1: List Your Five
Who do you spend the most time with? (Include virtual interactions)

1. _____
2. _____
3. _____
4. _____
5. _____

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Person

For each person, ask:
- **Energy**: Do they energize or drain me?
- **Growth**: Do they challenge me to grow or keep me comfortable?
- **Values**: Do their values align with mine?
- **Support**: Do they support my dreams or doubt them?

### Step 3: Categorize

- **Lifters**: People who elevate you (spend more time)
- **Neutrals**: People who neither help nor harm (maintain)
- **Drainers**: People who deplete you (reduce time or set boundaries)

## The Hard Truth

Sometimes the people holding you back are family, old friends, or long-time colleagues. You don't need to cut them off, but you may need to:
- Reduce time spent together
- Set clearer boundaries
- Stop seeking their approval
- Accept they may not understand your journey

## Expanding Your Circle

**Who do you need in your life that isn't there yet?**
- A mentor in your field
- An accountability partner
- A friend who shares your ambitions
- A community of like-minded growth-seekers

## Today's Action

1. Complete your Five People Audit
2. Identify ONE person you need more time with
3. Identify ONE boundary you need to set
4. Schedule time with someone who lifts you up

## Remember

Outgrowing people doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a growing person.
