# Physical Foundation - Movement

{{video:ecf0a25a-8df9-42e7-b62a-82118b555406}}

Your body is the vehicle for your transformation. Today, we establish a movement practice that sticks.

## Why Movement Matters

Physical movement isn't vanity—it's optimization:
- **Mental clarity**: Exercise increases BDNF (brain fertilizer)
- **Energy**: Movement creates energy, not depletes it
- **Mood**: Natural antidepressant and anti-anxiety
- **Confidence**: Physical capability builds mental confidence
- **Longevity**: Non-negotiable for long-term health

## The Movement Hierarchy

### Level 1: Daily Non-Negotiables (Everyone)
- 7,000-10,000 steps per day
- 2-minute movement breaks every hour
- Morning stretching or mobility (5-10 min)

### Level 2: Structured Exercise (3-5x per week)
- Strength training: 2-3x per week
- Cardiovascular: 2-3x per week
- Flexibility/Mobility: 2x per week

### Level 3: Athletic Performance (Optional)
- Sport-specific training
- Advanced programming
- Competition prep

## Start Where You Are

**Currently inactive?** Start with 10-minute daily walks
**Occasionally active?** Add 2 structured workouts per week
**Regularly active?** Optimize for consistency and progression

## The Minimum Effective Dose

You don't need hours in the gym. You need consistency.

**20-Minute Home Workout Template:**
- 5 min: Warm-up (jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings)
- 12 min: Circuit (3 rounds of: 10 push-ups, 15 squats, 20 mountain climbers, 30-sec plank)
- 3 min: Cool-down stretching

## Removing Exercise Barriers

- **No time**: Start with 10 minutes
- **No gym**: Bodyweight at home works
- **Not motivated**: Schedule it like a meeting
- **Too tired**: Movement creates energy
- **Don't know how**: Follow YouTube workouts
