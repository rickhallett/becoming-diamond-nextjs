## Why Morning Routines Matter

The first hour of your day sets the tone for everything that follows. A intentional morning routine:
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Creates momentum
- Establishes control over your day
- Builds discipline

## The Diamond Morning Framework

### 1. Movement (5-10 min)
Light exercise, stretching, or yoga to wake up your body

### 2. Mindfulness (5-10 min)
Meditation, breathing exercises, or journaling

### 3. Learning (5-10 min)
Read, listen to a podcast, or review your goals

### 4. Planning (5 min)
Set your top 3 priorities for the day

## Design Your Routine

**Current wake time**: _____
**Ideal wake time**: _____
**Morning activities to include**: _____

Start small: Pick just ONE activity to add to your morning tomorrow.

## Pro Tip

Don't try to overhaul your entire morning at once. Add one element at a time, making it automatic before adding the next.

## Tomorrow's Challenge

Wake up 15 minutes earlier and implement your first morning routine element.
