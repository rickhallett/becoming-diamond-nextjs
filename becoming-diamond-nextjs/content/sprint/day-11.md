# Financial Clarity Basics

{{video:ed4d0b12-2a21-4d41-b102-6c3ac51ad19c}}

You can't transform your life without financial clarity. Today, we start getting real about money.

## The Awareness Gap

Most people have no idea where their money actually goes. Financial transformation starts with awareness.

## The 30-Day Money Snapshot

### Income Sources
List all money coming in monthly:
- Primary income: $_____
- Side income: $_____
- Passive income: $_____
- **Total Monthly Income**: $_____

### Fixed Expenses (Same each month)
- Housing: $_____
- Insurance: $_____
- Subscriptions: $_____
- Debt payments: $_____
- **Total Fixed**: $_____

### Variable Expenses (Changes monthly)
- Food/Groceries: $_____
- Entertainment: $_____
- Shopping: $_____
- Misc: $_____
- **Total Variable**: $_____

### The Gap
**Income - Expenses = $_____**

## What the Numbers Tell You

- **Positive**: You're building wealth (are you investing it?)
- **Zero**: You're living paycheck to paycheck (time to optimize)
- **Negative**: Unsustainable (urgent action needed)

## The Three Money Moves

1. **Track everything** for 30 days (use an app or spreadsheet)
2. **Find the leaks** (subscriptions you forgot, impulse purchases)
3. **Redirect $100** to savings or debt payoff next month

## Today's Action

Download a money tracking app or create a simple spreadsheet. Log today's expenses.

## Remember

Financial freedom isn't about making more. It's about knowing where it goes and making it work for you.
