# Creative Thinking Frameworks

{{video:19706b3e-6a5f-44aa-b473-7fe7d18d7e79}}

Creativity isn't a gift—it's a skill. Today, you learn frameworks to generate breakthrough ideas on demand.

## Myth: Creativity is Innate
**Reality**: Creativity is systematic application of thinking tools.

## Framework 1: SCAMPER

Apply these prompts to any problem:

**S - Substitute**: What can you replace?
**C - Combine**: What can you merge?
**A - Adapt**: What can you adjust?
**M - Modify**: What can you change?
**P - Put to other use**: What's a new application?
**E - Eliminate**: What can you remove?
**R - Reverse**: What if you did the opposite?

**Example Problem**: "How to save time on meal prep"
- **Combine**: Batch cook multiple meals at once
- **Eliminate**: Cut out recipes with >5 ingredients
- **Reverse**: Order pre-prepped ingredients instead of full meals

## Framework 2: First Principles Thinking

Break problems down to fundamental truths and rebuild from there.

**Process:**
1. Identify the belief or assumption
2. Challenge it: "Is this actually true?"
3. Break down to basic elements
4. Rebuild from fundamentals

**Elon Musk Example**:
- **Assumption**: Batteries are expensive
- **Question**: Why are batteries expensive?
- **Break down**: What are battery materials? (Cobalt, nickel, carbon, etc.)
- **Rebuild**: Buy materials on commodity market and build battery
- **Result**: 80% cost reduction

## Framework 3: The 10x Question

Don't ask "How can I improve this 10%?"
Ask "How could I make this 10x better?"

10% thinking = incremental improvement
10x thinking = complete reimagination

**Example**:
- 10%: "How do I write emails faster?"
- 10x: "How do I eliminate 90% of email communication?"

## Framework 4: Forced Connections

Randomly select two unrelated concepts and find connections.

**Exercise**:
Your problem + random word (book, tree, coffee, ocean, phone) = new idea

**Example**:
Problem: "Increase productivity"
Random: "Ocean"
Connection: "Waves of focused work" → Time-blocking in 90-min waves

## Framework 5: Constraints Breeding Creativity

Add artificial constraints to force innovation:
- Time: "Solve this in 10 minutes"
- Budget: "With $0 spend"
- Resources: "Using only what's in this room"
- Format: "Explain it to a 5-year-old"

## Your Creative Practice

### Daily (5 min)
Ask: "What if I did the opposite of conventional wisdom here?"

### Weekly (20 min)
Run one problem through SCAMPER framework

### Monthly (1 hour)
First principles thinking on a major challenge

## Today's Exercise

Choose a current problem. Apply SCAMPER to generate 7 possible solutions (one for each letter).

## Remember

Creativity is connecting things. The more diverse your inputs (reading, experiences, conversations), the more connections you can make.
