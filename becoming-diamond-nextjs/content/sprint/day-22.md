# Decision-Making Frameworks

{{video:49903bed-23fd-4f88-89b2-ab258e98f77a}}

The quality of your life is determined by the quality of your decisions. Today, you learn to decide with confidence and clarity.

## The Decision Fatigue Problem

You make ~35,000 decisions per day. Each one depletes mental energy. Poor decisions compound.

**Solution**: Systematize decisions so important ones get your best energy.

## Framework 1: The Regret Minimization Framework

**Question**: When I'm 80, will I regret NOT doing this?

- If yes → Do it
- If no → Skip it

**Use for**: Big life decisions (career changes, relationships, moves)

**Jeff Bezos** used this to leave a stable job and start Amazon.

## Framework 2: The 10/10/10 Rule

How will I feel about this decision:
- **10 minutes** from now?
- **10 months** from now?
- **10 years** from now?

**Use for**: Emotional decisions, impulse choices, difficult conversations

**Example**:
- Eating junk food: Great/Bad/Bad = Don't do it
- Having a hard conversation: Bad/Good/Great = Do it

## Framework 3: The Two-Way Door Decision

**Irreversible (one-way door)**: Marriage, children, selling company
→ Take time, gather data, think deeply

**Reversible (two-way door)**: New job, city move, project
→ Decide fast, adjust later if wrong

Most decisions are two-way doors. We treat too many like one-way.

## Framework 4: The 80/20 Decision Rule

You need 80% certainty, not 100%. Waiting for perfect information is procrastination disguised as diligence.

**Process**:
1. Set decision deadline
2. Gather information (time-boxed)
3. When you hit 80% confidence OR deadline, decide
4. Commit fully
5. Course-correct as needed

## Framework 5: Values-Based Decision Matrix

When choosing between options, score each against your top 5 values (Day 4).

**Example**:
Values: Growth, Freedom, Family, Health, Impact

Option A scores: 8, 3, 7, 5, 9 = 32
Option B scores: 5, 9, 6, 8, 4 = 32

→ Equal on values, decide on other factors

## The Decision Journal

For major decisions, document:
- **Decision**: What I'm choosing
- **Reasoning**: Why I'm choosing it
- **Expected outcome**: What I think will happen
- **Actual outcome**: What actually happened (review in 3-6 months)

**Purpose**: Learn from patterns in your decision-making

## Decision Elimination Strategies

**Reduce decisions through**:
- Routines (same breakfast, workout time, morning ritual)
- Defaults (automatic savings, standard outfit, regular bedtime)
- Rules ("I don't eat sugar," "I don't check email before 10am")
- Batch processing (answer emails once/day, not continuously)

## The Decision Autopsy

Think of a major decision you regret.

## Remember

Indecision is a decision—usually the worst one. Decide, commit, adjust.
