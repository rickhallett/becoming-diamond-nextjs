# The Second Brain System

{{video:ff25ddf2-0576-417d-a861-985f548fa788}}

Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Today, you build a system that never forgets.

## The Problem with Mental Storage

Your brain can only hold 4-7 items in working memory. When you try to remember everything, you:
- Create mental clutter
- Experience constant anxiety
- Forget important details
- Waste mental energy

## What is a Second Brain?

A trusted external system that captures, organizes, and retrieves information so your brain is free to think, not store.

## The PARA Method

### P - Projects
Active work with deadlines
- *Example*: "Launch new website," "Plan summer trip"

### A - Areas
Ongoing responsibilities
- *Example*: Health, Finances, Career, Relationships

### R - Resources
Topics of interest
- *Example*: Marketing ideas, Recipes, Book notes

### A - Archives
Completed or inactive items
- *Example*: Finished projects, old reference materials

## Your Second Brain Stack

**Capture Everything:**
- Quick notes: Phone notes app or Notion mobile
- Tasks: Todoist, Things, or TickTick
- Ideas: Voice memos or quick capture app
- Documents: Google Drive or Dropbox
- Knowledge: Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote

**Processing Routine:**
1. Daily: Review captures, file into PARA
2. Weekly: Clean inbox, update projects
3. Monthly: Archive completed items

## The Capture Habit

Every idea, task, or piece of information goes into ONE inbox immediately. Process later.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1 (Today)
Choose your primary tool (Notion recommended for beginners)

### Step 2 (This Week)
Create your PARA structure:
- üìÅ Projects
- üìÅ Areas
- üìÅ Resources
- üìÅ Archives

### Step 3 (Next 30 Days)
Build the capture habit. Everything goes in the system.

## Common Mistakes

‚ùå Creating too many categories too soon
‚ùå Not having a single capture point
‚ùå Over-organizing before you have content
‚ùå Switching systems every month

‚úÖ Start simple, expand as needed
‚úÖ One inbox for everything
‚úÖ Organize based on action, not category
‚úÖ Commit to one system for 90 days minimum

## Today's Action

1. Choose your Second Brain tool
2. Create the four PARA folders
3. Move 5 items from your brain into the system

## Remember

The goal isn't a perfect system. It's a system you actually use.
