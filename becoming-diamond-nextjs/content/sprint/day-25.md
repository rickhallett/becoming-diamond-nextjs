# Legacy and Contribution

You're not just building a better life for yourself. You're building a legacy. Today, we define what you want to leave behind.

## The Legacy Question

*"If you died tomorrow, what would people remember you for?"*

Now the harder question:
*"Is that what you WANT to be remembered for?"*

## Two Types of Legacy

### 1. Personal Legacy
Impact on individuals in your circle:
- Family and loved ones
- Friends and colleagues
- Mentees and students
- Community members

**Questions**:
- How do you want your children (real or future) to describe you?
- What values do you want to pass on?
- What memories do you want to create?
- How do you want people to feel after spending time with you?

### 2. Contribution Legacy
Impact on the broader world:
- Your work and creations
- Problems you solved
- Lives you improved
- Ideas you spread
- Systems you built

**Questions**:
- What problem in the world bothers you most?
- What unique solution could you bring?
- What would you create if money weren't an issue?
- What expertise could you share that would help others?

## The Eulogy Exercise

**Write your own eulogy.** What do you want said about you at your funeral?

**Categories to address**:
- Character and values you embodied
- Relationships and how you loved
- Work and contribution
- Growth and transformation
- Impact on others

**Don't write what you've done. Write what you WILL DO.**

This becomes your roadmap.

## From Legacy to Daily Action

Legacy isn't built in a single heroic act. It's built in daily choices.

**Ask daily**: *"Is what I'm doing today aligned with who I want to be remembered as?"*

## The Contribution Hierarchy

### Level 1: Take Care of Yourself
Can't pour from an empty cup. Personal development enables contribution.

### Level 2: Take Care of Your Circle
Family, friends, team. Make their lives better.

### Level 3: Contribute to Your Field
Share knowledge, improve systems, mentor others.

### Level 4: Solve Problems at Scale
Create solutions that help thousands or millions.

**You must master each level before the next is sustainable.**

## Your Contribution Plan

**Phase 1** (This Year):
What will you contribute? _____

**Phase 2** (1-3 Years):
What bigger impact? _____

**Phase 3** (5-10 Years):
What's your moonshot contribution? _____

## Wealth vs. Legacy

**Wealth**: What you accumulate for yourself
**Legacy**: What you contribute to others

**The paradox**: Pursuing legacy often builds more wealth than pursuing wealth alone.

**Why**: Impact attracts opportunity. Selfishness repels it.

## The Anti-Legacy

What do you NOT want to be remembered for?
- Greed, selfishness, dishonesty?
- Absence from family?
- Wasted potential?
- Negativity and complaint?

**Use this as a filter.** When tempted by these, remember your legacy.

## Today's Legacy Action

Choose ONE action this week that moves you toward your desired legacy:
- Start mentoring someone
- Create content that helps others
- Have a meaningful conversation
- Begin a project that solves a problem
- Donate time or resources
- Write that book/article/post

**My action**: _____
**By when**: _____

## Remember

Everyone dies. Not everyone truly lives. Build a legacy worth leaving.
