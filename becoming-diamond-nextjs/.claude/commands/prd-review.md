# PRD Implementation Review

Review Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for implementation completion status and maintain an index of all reviewed PRDs.

## Usage

```bash
# Review a specific PRD
/prd-review docs/specs/blog/author-pages.prd.md

# Review by PRD name (searches docs/specs)
/prd-review "author pages"

# Re-check all previously reviewed PRDs for changes
/prd-review $INDEX=true

# Review specific PRD and update index
/prd-review docs/specs/video/video-integration-simplified.md
```

## Arguments

**$PRD** (optional): Path to PRD file or search term
- Can be full path: `docs/specs/blog/author-pages.prd.md`
- Can be partial name: `"author pages"` (will search)
- If omitted, shows PRD index

**$INDEX** (boolean, default: false): Re-review all indexed PRDs
- `$INDEX=true` - Reviews all previously indexed PRDs for changes
- `$INDEX=false` - Review single PRD specified in $PRD

## What This Command Does

### When Reviewing a Specific PRD ($PRD provided)

1. **Locate PRD File**
   - Search for PRD in docs/specs/ directory
   - Support both full paths and partial name matching
   - Confirm PRD file exists and is readable

2. **Analyze Implementation Status**
   - Read PRD requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Search codebase for related files and implementations
   - Calculate completion percentage per component:
     - Frontend: UI components, styling, integration
     - Backend: API endpoints, business logic, error handling
     - Data Layer: Schemas, migrations, seed data
     - Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
     - Documentation: Code comments, user docs, architecture

3. **Generate Status Report**
   - Overall completion percentage (0-100%)
   - Status emoji: 🟢 Complete | 🟡 Partial | 🟠 Minimal | 🔴 Stub | ⚫ Not Started
   - Breakdown by component
   - List of completed features
   - List of missing/incomplete features
   - Next steps and blockers

4. **Update PRD Index**
   - Add/update entry in `docs/planning/prd-index.md`
   - Record completion percentage
   - Track last review date
   - Link to detailed analysis

5. **Save Detailed Analysis**
   - Create analysis file: `docs/reports/prd-reviews/[prd-name]-review-[date].md`
   - Include full component breakdown
   - Code references with line numbers
   - Screenshots/examples where relevant
   - Recommendations for completion

### When Indexing ($INDEX=true)

1. **Load Previous Index**
   - Read `docs/planning/prd-index.md`
   - Parse all previously reviewed PRDs

2. **Check for Changes**
   - For each PRD in index:
     - Check if PRD file has been modified since last review
     - Check if related implementation files have changed
     - Detect new features added to PRD
     - Identify completed features since last review

3. **Re-Analyze Changed PRDs**
   - Run full analysis on any PRD that:
     - Has been modified since last review
     - Has related code changes
     - Was flagged as "in progress" last time

4. **Update Index**
   - Refresh completion percentages
   - Update status emojis
   - Add change summaries
   - Generate diff report showing progress since last review

5. **Generate Summary Report**
   - Overall project progress
   - PRDs that moved to complete
   - PRDs with increased completion %
   - PRDs with no progress
   - Recommended next PRDs to tackle

## Critical Path to Completion

### Immediate (1-2 hours) - Unblock Production
1. **Fix SlideContent Integration**
   - File: src/components/course/SlideContent.tsx
   - Change line 89 from dangerouslySetInnerHTML to ContentRenderer
   - Remove placeholder video div (lines 44-66)
   - Test with day-01.md

### Short Term (1-2 days) - Production Ready
2. **Add Remaining Video IDs**
   - Upload videos for days 8-30 to Bunny Stream
   - Add {{video:ID}} to markdown files

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Test iOS and Android
   - Verify HLS playback

### Medium Term (1 week) - Enhanced
4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Store playback position
   - Resume from last position
   - Show completion status

5. **Testing Suite**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests

## Code References

### Implementation Files
- src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx:1-100 - Video player component
- src/components/ContentRenderer.tsx:1-59 - HTML hydration
- src/lib/course-parser.ts:283-320 - Video extraction
- src/app/api/video/[videoId]/token/route.ts:1-36 - Token API

### Integration Points
- src/components/course/SlideContent.tsx:89 - **NEEDS FIX**

### Content Files
- content/sprint/day-01.md:19 - Video embedded
- content/sprint/day-02.md:23 - Video embedded
- (+ 5 more days)

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Integrate ContentRenderer** (1-2 hours)
   - This unblocks entire feature
   - Changes required: ~3 lines of code
   - Impact: 70% → 95% completion

2. **Add Remaining Videos** (varies)
   - Depends on content creation timeline
   - Technical implementation: trivial once videos exist

### Medium Priority
3. **Mobile Testing** (2-3 hours)
4. **Progress Tracking** (4-6 hours)
5. **Error Handling** (2-3 hours)

### Low Priority
6. **Testing Suite** (1-2 days)
7. **Analytics** (2-3 days)

---

## Technical Debt

1. No tests (0% coverage)
2. No analytics tracking
3. No progress persistence
4. Unused legacy media fields in markdown

---

## Dependencies

**Completed**:
- ✅ hls.js installed
- ✅ Bunny Stream account configured
- ✅ Environment variables set

**Pending**:
- None

```

## Command Implementation Details

### Step 1: Parse Arguments
```bash
# Determine mode
if $INDEX == true:
    mode = "index_all"
elif $PRD provided:
    mode = "review_single"
else:
    mode = "show_index"
```

### Step 2: Find PRD File(s)
```bash
# For single PRD review
if mode == "review_single":
    # Try as full path first
    if file exists at $PRD:
        prd_file = $PRD
    else:
        # Search docs/specs for matching PRD
        search_results = glob("docs/specs/**/*.prd.md")
        prd_file = fuzzy_match($PRD, search_results)

        if not found:
            error "PRD not found: $PRD"
            suggest similar PRDs

# For index mode
if mode == "index_all":
    # Load previously reviewed PRDs from index
    index_file = "docs/planning/prd-index.md"
    prd_list = parse_index(index_file)
```

### Step 3: Analyze Implementation
```bash
# For each PRD to review:
for prd in prd_list:
    # Read PRD content
    prd_content = read_file(prd.path)

    # Extract requirements
    requirements = extract_requirements(prd_content)
    acceptance_criteria = extract_acceptance_criteria(prd_content)

    # Search for implementations
    for requirement in requirements:
        files = search_codebase(requirement.keywords)
        implementation_status = analyze_files(files, requirement)

    # Calculate completion %
    completion = calculate_completion(implementation_status)

    # Generate status report
    report = generate_report(prd, completion, implementation_status)

    # Save detailed analysis
    save_analysis(report, f"docs/reports/prd-reviews/{prd.name}-review-{date}.md")

    # Update index entry
    update_index(prd, completion, date)
```

### Step 4: Generate Summary
```bash
# Show results to user
if mode == "review_single":
    display report
    display "PRD index updated"

if mode == "index_all":
    display summary:
        - Total PRDs reviewed
        - Completion changes
        - New completions
        - Recommended next steps

if mode == "show_index":
    display index file
```

## Index Management

### Index File Location
`docs/planning/prd-index.md`

### Index Format
- Markdown table format
- Sortable by status, date, completion %
- Links to PRD files and review reports
- Quick stats at top
- Change history at bottom

### Update Strategy
- Atomic updates (don't lose data)
- Keep history of changes
- Track velocity metrics
- Generate diff reports

## Error Handling

- **PRD not found**: Suggest similar PRDs in docs/specs
- **Index file missing**: Create new index automatically
- **Parse error**: Show error, skip to next PRD
- **No implementation found**: Mark as "Not Started" (not error)
- **Ambiguous search**: Show multiple matches, ask user to clarify

## Performance

- Cache file searches (glob results)
- Parallel analysis of multiple PRDs (when $INDEX=true)
- Skip unchanged PRDs (check file modification time)
- Incremental index updates (don't regenerate everything)

## Usage Examples
