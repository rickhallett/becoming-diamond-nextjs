   - Review security best practices and CSRF protection
   - Check for any breaking changes or migration guides from v4 to v5

2. **Analysis Phase - Current Architecture**
   - Analyze the existing GitHub OAuth implementation in `/api/auth/route.ts`
   - Review the member portal structure (`/app/*` routes)
   - Identify all routes that need protection
   - Assess the current Decap CMS authentication (should remain separate)
   - Evaluate database requirements (user storage, sessions, accounts)
   - Consider the existing tech stack (Next.js 15, Turbopack, TypeScript)
   - Identify potential conflicts or integration challenges

3. **PRD Creation - Comprehensive Planning**

   - Ask specific questions about preferences:
     * Database choice (if not already in project)
     * Email provider preference
     * Additional SSO providers beyond Google/GitHub
     * Session strategy preference
     * UI/UX preferences for auth pages
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

## Technical Guidelines

**NextAuth.js v5 Best Practices:**
- Use the new `auth.ts` configuration pattern
- Leverage App Router integration with `auth()` helper
- Use middleware for route protection (not HOCs)
- Implement proper TypeScript types for session and user
- Use database sessions for better security and flexibility
- Configure secure cookie settings

**Database Integration:**
- Recommend Prisma ORM for type safety and migrations
- Create schema for: User, Account, Session, VerificationToken
- Follow NextAuth.js adapter schema requirements
- Add indexes for performance (email, session tokens)
- Consider soft deletes for user accounts

**Email Provider Setup:**
- Recommend Resend for modern API and good DX
- Implement magic link authentication (passwordless)
- Create email templates for verification and sign-in
- Handle email sending errors gracefully
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

**OAuth Provider Configuration:**
- Set up Google OAuth with proper scopes
