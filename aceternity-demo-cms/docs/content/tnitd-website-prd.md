## Implementation Notes

### Core Layout Structure

```tsx
// Ultra-minimal layout with focus on content
<main className="bg-black min-h-screen">
  <nav className="fixed top-0 w-full bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm z-50">
    {/* Minimal navigation - logo + 3 items max */}
  </nav>

  <section className="hero h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
    {/* Full-screen hero with single CTA */}
  </section>

  <article className="prose prose-invert max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    {/* Long-form content sections */}
  </article>
</main>
```

### Animation Strategy

```tsx
// Coherent transition system
const transitions = {
  fadeIn: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    transition: { duration: 0.5, ease: [0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1] },
  },
  stagger: {
    animate: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } },
  },
};
```

### Typography Scale

```css
/* Ultrathink heading system */
.h1 {
  font-size: clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem);
  font-weight: 100;
}
.h2 {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3.5rem);
  font-weight: 200;
}
.body {
  font-size: clamp(1.125rem, 2vw, 1.25rem);
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

### Page Structure
